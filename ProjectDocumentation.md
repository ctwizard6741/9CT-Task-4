Identifying and Defining: 
My game will address an entertainment issue in todays society. THe media does not have enough fun and entertaining games sso the game I am developing strives to break that barrier for fun. The game I am going to create is a 2D maze game on unity, with different levels and checkpoints. 

Requirements Outline
Input: I will need Unity to make this game and well working player and game scripts so the game ends up functioning well. 
Processing: It needs to start with a splashscreen to let the user have an option to play or quit. When the click button is played, it will load them into the first level of the game or otherwise the easiest level and as they continue through checkpoints, they will be progresed to harder levels. 
Output: This will create a very well functioning game which is interesting for users. It will respond to user inputs, for example when the space bar is clicked, the character on screen will jump and when the A and D buttons are clicked, the character will move in the respective directions. 
Transmission: There will be no data transmission requirements for this Unity game. Player progress and checkpoints will be saved through the Unity feature prefabs. 
Storage: The game will store a small amount of data on the players device to save progress and preferences.

Functional and Non-Functional Requirements
Functional: My game will need to be able to start a new game, pause during gameplay and end games that were completed or where the user quitted. Player input controls must also work funcitonally such as when the A or D buttons are pressed, the character must respond to the commands. It must also save and load progress. 
Non Functional: The game must run smoothly, protect user privacy and security and should be reliable making sure that it doesn't get corrupted too much. 

Social and Ethical Issues
Social and ethical concerns must be taken into consideration when making this game. It must respect user privacy and security, the game will have no online chats or mulitplayer features to avoid cyberbullying, it must be inclusive and accessible for all people regardless of ability and should make sure that users screen time and wellbeing are controlled through the fact that the game is designed for short gameplay sessions.

Researching and Planning: 
There are couple of games that I feel have the same values that my game does and have taken inspiration from. I have also made a PMI chart to see the positives and the neagtives of these games that I have taken inspiration from. 

Minecratft: 
P(Plus): The gameis highly engaging and requires creativiyt and it's simple blocky desgins makes it easier for new users to understand inputs and functions. 
M(Minus): Doesn't have a clear objective so it can confuse new users to the game as to what they are requitred to do and the game is designed for long gaming sessions so it can impact user wellbeing. 
I(Implication): It is an open world game so it gives freedom to users but no clear objective will confuse users. 

Roblox:
P(Plus): Has many different types of games which gives a variety of thwmes and a clear objective for users. 
M(Minus): Too many objectives won't give a main theme for the game and may not be beginner friendly as new users may not understand how to function the game. 
I(Implication): Game has different objectives sets clear game expectations for users however too may objectives causes the game to have no main theme to it and makes it not very beginner friendly for new users.
