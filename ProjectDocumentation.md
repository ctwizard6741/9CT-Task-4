Identifying and Defining: 
My game will address an entertainment issue in todays society. THe media does not have enough fun and entertaining games sso the game I am developing strives to break that barrier for fun. The game I am going to create is a 2D maze game on unity, with different levels and checkpoints. 

Requirements Outline
Input: I will need Unity to make this game and well working player and game scripts so the game ends up functioning well. 
Processing: It needs to start with a splashscreen to let the user have an option to play or quit. When the click button is played, it will load them into the first level of the game or otherwise the easiest level and as they continue through checkpoints, they will be progresed to harder levels. 
Output: This will create a very well functioning game which is interesting for users. It will respond to user inputs, for example when the space bar is clicked, the character on screen will jump and when the A and D buttons are clicked, the character will move in the respective directions. 
Transmission: There will be no data transmission requirements for this Unity game. Player progress and checkpoints will be saved through the Unity feature prefabs. 
Storage: The game will store a small amount of data on the players device to save progress and preferences.

Functional and Non-Functional Requirements
Functional: My game will need to be able to start a new game, pause during gameplay and end games that were completed or where the user quitted. Player input controls must also work funcitonally such as when the A or D buttons are pressed, the character must respond to the commands. It must also save and load progress. 
Non Functional: The game must run smoothly, protect user privacy and security and should be reliable making sure that it doesn't get corrupted too much. 

Social and Ethical Issues
Social and ethical concerns must be taken into consideration when making this game. It must respect user privacy and security, the game will have no online chats or mulitplayer features to avoid cyberbullying, it must be inclusive and accessible for all people regardless of ability and should make sure that users screen time and wellbeing are controlled through the fact that the game is designed for short gameplay sessions.
